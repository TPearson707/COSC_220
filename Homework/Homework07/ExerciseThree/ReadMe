TIME COMPARISON:

Linked List:
The new and improved linked list is much more efficient. It beats out all categories when it comes to the push_front function.
When it comes to the push_back functoin is barely loses to the vector, but still remains superior to the standard STL list

Vector:
The vector is absolute trash when it comes to pushing items from the front. However, that is not what it was designed for. When it comes to pushing frrom the back the vector wins every time with the Linked List coming in a close second place.

STL List:
The STL List performs well in both categories, however, the Linked List has both push_front and push_back functionality as well, and is faster.
